# K8s event source with Kafka channel

In this example we are going to use the K8s event source from the first eventing example. However, we will replace the default channel implementation of knative with a Kafka cluster.

## Instructions

1. Create the ksvc (our event subscriber):

```
kubectl apply -f 000-ksvc.yaml
```

1. Create a kafka channel which will receive and distribute the events generated by the eventing source:

```
kubectl apply -f 010-channel.yaml
```

1. Create the k8s event source (we have set up the service account with the necessary permissions earlier):

```
kubectl apply -f 020-k8s-events.yaml
```

1. Finally, create the subscription

```
kubectl apply -f 030-subscription.yaml
```

1. To view the subscriber's logs, execute:

```
kubectl logs --selector serving.knative.dev/service=channel-display0 -c user-container
```
